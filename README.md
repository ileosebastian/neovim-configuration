# A custom neovim configuration, by ileosebastian
This is my custom configuration about neovim text editor.

----

This customization covers:
- **Colorschemes** like habamax, [ofirkai](https://github.com/ofirgall/ofirkai.nvim).
- **Plugins** handled by [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) package manager.
- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) to find files by buffer, keyworkds, names, etc.
- **Keymaps** to improve productivity and confort when coding.
- Let the editor use the same *clipboard* as the system.
- All the conventions to be able to use **LSPs** by using [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim).
- [Nvim tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua) to show the project structure graphically.

### Futures plugins to add:
- [Toggleterm](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim) to show a new terminal session.
- [Nvim comment](https://github.com/terrortylor/nvim-comment) to comment the code more comfortably.
- [Nvim cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) to show completions while typing.
